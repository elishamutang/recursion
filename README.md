## Contents

This package contains two JS files namely fibSeq.js and mergeSort.js as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The concept of recursion
is emphasized here in both fibSeq.js and mergeSort.js to produce their respective outputs.

## fibSeq.js

fibSeq.js contains two methods of producing a Fibonnaci sequence up to and including the nth number. The first method was by using
plain iteration using a for loop whereas the second method is by using recursion.

## mergeSort.js

mergeSort.js is an algortihm called 'Merge Sort' that utilizes recursion to sort an unsorted array. In a nutshell, the algorithm takes the mid-point
index of an array and splits itself into two sub-arrays recursively, sorts the sub array in ascending order, and merge them to form
the resulting sorted array.
